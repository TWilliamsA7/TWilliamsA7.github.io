Plan for Portfolio Website

Home Page
    This should have my name and a single sentence to drive impact, some graphic to fill in the space as well

About Me
    This should be on the home page and be scrolled down to or linked to scroll down
    At the bottom of the page, invite to projects and contact

Projects 
    Display projects in card format
        Each of the cards will have an image associated with the project, and short description
        Clicking on the cards will link to the page associated with that project
    Sort the projects in different ways, via a dropdown menu (language, recency, purpose)

Resume
    Just display the resume

Contact Me
    Look into making an actual form which can be used to contact and just show everything in general
